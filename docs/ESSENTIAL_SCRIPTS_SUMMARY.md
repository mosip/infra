# Essential Scripts Summary

## ðŸ§¹ **Cleanup Completed**

The following outdated files were removed as they referenced deprecated phase-based deployment:

- `.github/scripts/recover-local-state.sh` - Old manual recovery for phase-based deployment
- `.github/scripts/terraform-troubleshoot.sh` - Redundant with workflow pre-operation cleanup  
- `docs/LOCAL_BACKEND_RESILIENCE.md` - Documented removed phase-based approach

## Essential Scripts Retained

### **Core State Management**
- **`decrypt-state.sh`** - Decrypts GPG-encrypted state files with custom naming
- **`encrypt-state.sh`** - Encrypts state files with custom naming preservation
- **`configure-backend.sh`** - Generates backend.tf for custom state paths

### **Security & Safety**  
- **`terraform-git-safety.sh`** - **CRITICAL** - Prevents committing .terraform/ and unencrypted state
- **`setup-gpg.sh`** - Sets up GPG encryption keys

### **Cloud Storage & State Locking**
- **`setup-cloud-storage.sh`** - Creates S3/Azure/GCS buckets for remote state
- **`cleanup-state-locking.sh`** - Manages DynamoDB/Azure/GCS state locking

### **Testing & Validation**
- **`test-state-locking.sh`** - Tests state locking functionality  
- **`test-cleanup-state-locking.sh`** - Tests cleanup procedures
- **`validate-workflow-integration.sh`** - Validates complete workflow integration

## ðŸ”„ **Current Approach**

**Enhanced Workflows** now handle resilience through:
- âœ… **Pre-operation cleanup** (replaces terraform-troubleshoot.sh functionality)
- âœ… **Emergency state saves** on cancellation (replaces recover-local-state.sh)
- âœ… **Standard terraform operations** (no more phase-based deployment)
- âœ… **Modern backend configuration** (no deprecated -state flags)
- âœ… **Custom state file naming** with GPG encryption

Your infrastructure is now streamlined with only essential, actively-used scripts! ðŸŽ‰
